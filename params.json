In order to successfully test your application, you will need to set up a backend server which is currently written in node.js (with mongodb backend) and is available [here] (https://github.com/raghavneesh/hh-appserver/) (_instructions to run the server can be found in the server repository_.)\r\n\r\n2. Once the server is hosted you will need to change the value of ``` server_url ``` in ``` android/res/values/strings.xml ``` to point the host correctly, before you complie the application.\r\n\r\n3. The unit tests are present the ``` test/ ``` folder, which can be opened up as a separate project and will needed to be compiled independent of the main project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
